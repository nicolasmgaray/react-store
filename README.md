Small application to achieve the [aerolab coding challenge](https://aerolab.co/coding-challenge-instructions) and demonstrate the SSR capabilities of Next.Js in conjunction with Redux and Redux-Thunk.

## Functionality
  - You can redeem products by hovering over them, as long as you have enough points
  - If you don't have enough points, the app will tell you how many more you need to be able to redeem it
  - Clicking the coin in the points counter will add 1000 points more to your account (Shh! Its a secret)
  - The history tab will show a list of all the redeemed products.
  - You can sort the products list.
